Line 1 is variable assignment and returns the value of the number 2.
Line 2 prints nil on a newline to the console but returns nil since it uses puts.
Line 3 returns the string 'Joe' since it uses p and it returns the value of the object passed to it.
Line 4 is variable assignment and returns the string 'four'
Line 5 uses print in variable assignment so it also returns nil.
